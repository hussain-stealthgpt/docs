# Pricing

StealthGPT API uses a token-based pricing model. You purchase tokens in advance and consume them as you make API requests.

## Token Consumption Rates

Different endpoints and settings consume tokens at different rates:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Endpoint</th>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Token Conversion Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">/api/stealthify</td>
      <td>Standard (business=false)</td>
      <td>1 standard token = 1 stealth token</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Business (business=true)</td>
      <td>1 business token = 10 stealth tokens</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/stealthify/articles</td>
      <td>Any</td>
      <td>1 article generation = 50,000 stealth tokens</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Note>
  The business mode uses a model that is 10x more powerful than the standard engine, providing higher quality and more undetectable content, but it consumes tokens at a higher rate.
</Note>
