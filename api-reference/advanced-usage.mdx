# Advanced Usage Techniques

Master these techniques to get the most out of the StealthGPT API for your content generation and rephrasing needs.

## Optimizing Tone Selection

StealthGPT offers several tone options to match your content needs:

<Card title="Tone Options" icon="sliders">
  <CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Standard" icon="pen">
      Default tone for general-purpose content. Balanced readability and formality.
    </Card>
    <Card title="HighSchool" icon="graduation-cap">
      Simpler style with occasional grammatical errors. High on Flesch-Kincaid Readability.
    </Card>
    <Card title="College" icon="book">
      Semi-complex style with occasional minor errors. Medium Flesch-Kincaid score.
    </Card>
    <Card title="PhD" icon="user-graduate">
      Complex, sophisticated style. No grammatical errors. Low Flesch-Kincaid score.
    </Card>
  </CardGroup>
</Card>

Choose the tone that best matches your target audience and content requirements.

## Crafting Effective Prompts

The quality of generated content depends significantly on your prompt. Here are some techniques to improve your prompts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Instead of: "Write about cars"
    
    Try: "Write about the environmental impact of electric vehicles compared to traditional combustion engines"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Context">
    Instead of: "Write a product description"
    
    Try: "Write a product description for a premium leather wallet targeted at young professionals who value both style and functionality"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specify Format">
    Instead of: "Write about climate change"
    
    Try: "Create a 5-point listicle about practical steps individuals can take to reduce their carbon footprint"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define Voice and Tone">
    Instead of: "Write about cryptocurrency"
    
    Try: "Explain cryptocurrency concepts in a conversational tone as if speaking to someone with no technical background"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Length Optimization

For optimal performance, we recommend keeping responses under 2,000 characters. When you need longer content:

1. Break down your content needs into smaller, focused requests
2. Use the `/api/stealthify/articles` endpoint for complete blog articles
3. Chain multiple requests together, using the output of one as input for another

## Using Templates

You can include templates in your prompts to guide the structure of generated content:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Please write an email following this template:\n\nSubject: [Product] - New Features\n\nHello [Name],\n\nI'm excited to share the latest updates to [Product]...\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
  "rephrase": false
}
```

## Iterative Rephrasing

For maximum undetectability, consider an iterative approach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Initial Content">
    Create the first version of your content with `rephrase: false`
  </Step>
  <Step title="First Rephrasing">
    Submit the generated content with `rephrase: true`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Rephrasing">
    For even higher undetectability, submit the rephrased content for another round
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Too many rephrasing iterations may affect content coherence or meaning. Test and find the optimal balance.
</Warning>

## Multilingual Support

StealthGPT automatically detects and works with any language. To use this feature effectively:

- Ensure your prompt is written in your target language
- Keep the `isMultilingual` parameter set to `true` (default)
- For content that switches between languages, provide examples in your prompt

## Business Mode for Critical Content

When undetectability and quality are paramount:

<Note>
  Setting `business: true` uses a model 10x more powerful than the standard engine, significantly improving content quality and undetectability.
</Note>

This is particularly useful for:
- Academic content
- Professional documents
- Content that will undergo AI detection scrutiny
- Technical or complex subjects

Remember that business mode consumes tokens at a higher rate.
