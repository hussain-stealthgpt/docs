## Obtaining Your API Token

To use the StealthGPT API, you'll need an API token that uniquely identifies your account and authorizes your requests.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create an account on the [StealthGPT platform](https://stealthgpt.ai)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purchase Tokens">
    Buy tokens to enable API access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Your API Token">
    Find your API token in the StealthGPT dashboard under the "API Key" tab
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your API token secure. Don't share it publicly or commit it to version control systems. Treat it as you would any sensitive credential.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Token

Include your API token in the headers of all requests to the StealthGPT API.

```bash
curl --location 'https://stealthgpt.ai/api/stealthify' \
    --header 'api-token: YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "prompt": "Your content prompt",
        "rephrase": true,
        "tone": "professional",
        "mode": "standard",
        "business": false
    }'
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with the actual token from your dashboard.
</Tip>

## Token Security

If you believe your API token has been compromised:

1. Go to the StealthGPT dashboard under the "API Key" tab
2. Use the regenerate option to create a new API token
3. Update your applications with the new token as soon as possible
